- Run 24/7 with no delay
- No hardware utilization, hence no heating up of PC.

> *Read [this](https://github.com/MaxMady/BloxFlip-Auto-Rain-Joiner#contribute) if you want to know Crash revealer & ⭐ the repo for better projects*

## Features

- Custom Discord webhook logger
- Auto rain join/leave
- Trivia notifier
- Windows notification
- Super stealthy
- Anti-Bot Bypass

## Why was this project made?
> The main goal behind creation of such a program was to provide free robux to people who can't afford it. [EzRain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg0wg09WTjs) as well sells this, but at unfairingly overpriced, which is definetly a scam and therefore I wanted to contribute whatever I could!
